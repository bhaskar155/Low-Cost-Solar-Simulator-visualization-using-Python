Low-Cost Solar Simulator
Technologies: Python, NASA POWER API, Pandas, Matplotlib

Project Overview

This project presents a **cost-effective solar simulator** designed to replicate real-world **solar irradiance** and **ambient temperature** 
conditions for laboratory testing of solar panels. Unlike expensive commercial simulators, this solution integrates live data from the **NASA POWER API** 
and uses a Python-based backend to offer accurate and dynamic simulation capabilities.

The tool is highly customizable, user-friendly, and serves as an accessible alternative for educational institutions and researchers.

Cleaned and Formatted Output using Pandas.
Dynamic Visualizationusing Matplotlib for better insight and analysis.
Automatic Excel Export using OpenPyXL for record-keeping and future use.
Interactive CLI for easy user input and flexibility.
Robust Error Handlingfor invalid inputs and API failures.

How It Works

  User Input
   - Latitude and longitude (e.g., 23.2, 77.4)
   - Date (e.g., 25-06-2025)
  
  Data Fetching
  Connects to the NASA POWER API
  Retrieves hourly values for:
    Solar Irradiance (ALLSKY_SFC_SW_DWN)
    Temperature (T2M)
  
  Stored in a structured DataFrame
  Output Generation
  
  Saved to Excel (solar_intensity_and_temperature.xlsx)
  Visualized using line plots

üìë Requirements
    pip install requests, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl
